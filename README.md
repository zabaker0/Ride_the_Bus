#Round 1

#Round 2- Chris Tu

#Round 3 Chris Castro 
Using the previus two cards I created a function that decides wether the card drawn is lower than the lowest value in the held cards, and the same if the card drawn is higher value than the highest value card, this is to determine if the card is outside of the value of the cards.  And to determine if the card is inside I created the the function inside, meaning that if the card drawn is < than the highest value and > than the lowest value.

#Round 4- Zach Baker

#Deck - Chris Castro 
For the deck we start by creating a class for the card, this contains 3 obj inside of it, suit, value, and color.
After that we create a class for the deck this establishes the 4 different suits and it also gives the card values for 1 to 13 to create the 52 cards

#Graphics - Zach Baker
For the graphics to function the card pngs need to be downloaded and stored in the same folder/locations as the Python file
